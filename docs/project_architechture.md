âœ¦ Based on the file and directory structure, this is a classic Laravel (PHP) application, likely serving as an API backend for an order management system.

Here are the main architectural pieces:


* Framework: It's built using the Laravel framework, a popular PHP framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The presence of
  artisan, composer.json with Laravel dependencies, and the standard directory structure (app, config, routes, etc.) confirm this.


* Core Application Logic (The "M" and "C" of MVC):
    * Models (`app/Models`): These PHP classes represent the data structures of the application, like Order, Product, and User. They are responsible for
      interacting with the database.
    * Controllers (`app/Http/Controllers`): These handle incoming HTTP requests, orchestrate the business logic, and return responses (likely JSON, given the
      sod-api-master name).
    * Routes (`routes/api.php`): This file defines the API endpoints (URLs) and maps them to specific controller methods. Its presence and the project's name
      suggest a primary focus on providing a web API.


* Database Layer:
    * The system uses a relational database, managed through Laravel's migration system (database/migrations). This allows for version-controlled, programmatic
      changes to the database schema.


* Asynchronous Processing:
    * The app/Jobs directory (e.g., CheckCourierStatus.php, SendSms.php) indicates the use of a queue system. This allows the application to offload
      time-consuming tasks to a background process, improving API response times.


* Frontend Asset Management:
    * package.json and webpack.mix.js show that Node.js/npm and Laravel Mix (a wrapper around Webpack) are used to compile frontend assets like JavaScript and
      CSS, even if the project is primarily an API.


* Environment and Deployment:
    * The docker-compose.yml and docker/ directory signify that the application is containerized using Docker. This provides a consistent and isolated environment
      for development and deployment, typically involving separate containers for the PHP application, a web server (like Nginx), and a database.
